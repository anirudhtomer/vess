\description{
The function \code{get_cohort_mindet_VE_crr} calculates the minimum detectable variant and vaccine-specific efficacy (VE) for a given sample size, power, and type-I error rate.
The efficacy is defined as \verb{VE = 1 - cumulative-risk ratio}, and the function returns
both absolute and relative minimum detectable VE. The NULL hypothesis is that \code{VE = 0} and
the alternate hypothesis in that \verb{VE is not equal to 0}.
}
\details{
In this function efficacy is defined as \verb{VE = 1 - cumulative-risk ratio}, where 'cumulative-risk ratio' is
the ratio of cumulative-risk of being a case of a particular variant/variant among the groups being compared.
When the groups being compared are a particular vaccine versus placebo then we call the VE
as the absolute VE of the vaccine. For \code{M} vaccines there are \code{M} absolute VE, one each for the \code{M} vaccines.
When the groups being compared are a particular vaccine versus another vaccine then we call the VE
as the relative VE of the vaccines, for a particular variant. For \code{M} vaccines and \code{I} variants there are \verb{I x 2 x utils::combn(M, 2)}
permutations of relative VE of two vaccines against the same variant.

We first transform the user inputs for \code{I} variants and \code{M} vaccines into a \verb{(I + 1) x (M + 1)} cross table of
cumulative-risks of being a case or a control over the study period. The overall sum of all cumulative-risks,
i.e., all cells, of this table is 1. The first row of our cumulative-risk table contain cumulative-risk of being a control.
The first column corresponds to subjects who are unvaccinated.
Thus, the cell \verb{\{1,1\}} contains the probability (cumulative-risk) that over the study period a subject will be a control and unvaccinated.
The remaining \code{ÃŒ} rows correspond to subjects who are cases of a particular variant/variant of the pathogen,
and the remaining \code{M} columns correspond to subjects who are vaccinated with a particular vaccine.

In general, while calculating minimum detectable VE it is not necessary to ask for \code{anticipated_VE_for_each_brand_and_variant}.
The reason we need it in the multiple variant and multiple vaccine scenario is explained next.

After we obtain the cumulative risk table our next step is to calculate the minimum detectable VE for each absolute and relative VE combination.
For absolute VE we extract a \verb{I x 2} sub-table of cumulative-risk from the larger \verb{(I + 1) x (M + 1)} cross table of
cumulative-risks. The two columns are for the vaccine of interest and placebo.
The effective sample size for this sub-table and the absolute VE is then
\code{total_subjects * sub_table_probability_sum * (1 - prob_missing_data) * (1 - confounder_adjustment_Rsquared)}.
Here \code{sub_table_probability_sum} is the sum of the cells of the sub_table.
This sum corresponds to the percentage of the \code{total_subjects} that can be used for a specific absolute VE calculation.
The effective overall coverage in this sub-table is the rescaled probability of being vaccinated in the \verb{I x 2} sub-table.
The effective overall attack rate in unvaccinated in this sub-table is the cumulative-risk of being a case of strain
of interest among the unvaccinated subjects in the \verb{I x 2} sub-table.
We then simply pass these adjusted parameters to the function \code{epi.sscohortc} of the R package \code{epiR} to obtain the minimum detectable absolute VE.
For relative VE the process is similar to absolute VE, except that instead of placebo we select a \verb{I x 2} sub-table where
the columns are the two vaccines of interest.
}
\examples{
As an example we recommend running the function without passing any parameter to it.
The default scenario is for three vaccines and three pathogen variants.
