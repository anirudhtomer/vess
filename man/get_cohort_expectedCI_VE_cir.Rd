\arguments{
\item{anticipated_VE_for_each_brand_and_variant}{a matrix of vaccine efficacy of each vaccine (row) against each variant (column). Each value must be a real number between 0 and 1.}

\item{brand_proportions_in_vaccinated}{a vector denoting the proportion in which vaccines are given in the vaccinated subjects of the study cohort. Each value of this vector must be a real number between 0 and 1 and the sum of the values of this vector must be equal to 1.}

\item{overall_vaccine_coverage}{the proportion of the study cohort that will be vaccinated. It should be a real number between 0 and 1.}

\item{proportion_variants_in_unvaccinated_cases}{a vector of the proportions in which each variant is expected to be present in the unvaccinated and infected subjects in the study cohort. Each value of this vector must be a real number between 0 and 1 and the sum of the values of this vector must be equal to 1.}

\item{overall_attack_rate_in_unvaccinated}{the proportion of the study cohort that is expected to infected over the study period. It should be a real number between 0 and 1.}

\item{confounder_adjustment_Rsquared}{we use this parameter to adjust the calculations for potential confounders using the methodology proposed by Hsieh and Lavori (2000). It represents the amount of variance (R^2) explained in a regression model where vaccination status is the outcome and confounders of interest are predictors. It is a numeric that must take a value between 0 (no adjustment for confounders) and 1.}

\item{prob_missing_data}{to adjust the calculations for non-informative and random subject loss to follow-up/dropout. it should take a numeric value between 0 and 1.}

\value{
A data frame consisting of the input parameters, absolute and relative VE combinations,
and the expected lower and expected upper width of the confidence intervals for each absolute and relative VE combination.

\description{
The function \code{get_cohort_expectedCI_VE_cir} simulates confindence intervals for variant and vaccine-specific efficacy (VE) for a given sample size.
The efficacy is defined as \verb{VE = 1 - cumulative-incidence ratio}, and the function returns expected lower and expected upper confidence interval limit
for both absolute and relative VE.
}
\details{
In this function efficacy is defined as \verb{VE = 1 - cumulative-incidence ratio}, where 'cumulative-incidence ratio' is
the ratio of cumulative-incidence of being a case of a particular variant/variant among the groups being compared.
When the groups being compared are a particular vaccine versus placebo then we call the VE
as the absolute VE of the vaccine. For \code{M} vaccines there are \code{M} absolute VE, one each for the \code{M} vaccines.
When the groups being compared are a particular vaccine versus another vaccine then we call the VE
as the relative VE of the vaccines, for a particular variant. For \code{M} vaccines and \code{I} variants there are \verb{I x 2 x utils::combn(M, 2)}
permutations of relative VE of two vaccines against the same variant.

We first transform the user inputs for \code{I} variants and \code{M} vaccines into a \verb{(I + 1) x (M + 1)} cross table of
cumulative-incidences of being a case or a control over the study period. The overall sum of all cumulative-incidences,
i.e., all cells, of this table is 1. The first row of our cumulative-incidence table contain cumulative-incidence of being a control.
The first column corresponds to subjects who are unvaccinated.
Thus, the cell \verb{\{1,1\}} contains the probability (cumulative-incidence) that over the study period a subject will be a control and unvaccinated.
The remaining \code{ÃŒ} rows correspond to subjects who are cases of a particular variant/variant of the pathogen,
and the remaining \code{M} columns correspond to subjects who are vaccinated with a particular vaccine.

The next step is to simulate the data. To speed up our computations we sample an \verb{(I + 1) x (M + 1)}
cross table of data from a multinomial distribution with probabilities taken from our cumulative-incidence table.
The total subjects sampled in the cross table are are \code{total_subjects * (1 - prob_missing_data)}.
We then estimate the absolute and relative VE of each vaccine using the cumulative-incidences based on the sampled data.
The confidence intervals with widths \verb{[100*alpha/2, 100*(1 - alpha/2)]\%} are obtained using normal approximation
to the distribution of log of cumulative-incidence ratio (Morris and Gardner, 1988).
To adjust for confounders, the standard-error used in the confidence interval is rescaled to \code{SE/(1 - confounder_adjustment_Rsquared)} (Hsieh and Lavori, 2000)
We repeat this procedure \code{nsims} times, and in each such simulation we obtain \code{nsims} confidence intervals.

To conduct simulations faster all the calculations are done without using for loops.
Instead we use a three-dimensional R arrays, with one-dimension for \code{nsims},
another for the sample size vector \code{total_subjects},
and another for a vector containing the flattened cross table of simulated data on cases and controls.

\examples{
As an example we recommend running the function without passing any parameter to it.
The default scenario is for three vaccines and three pathogen variants.
