#' Expected lower and expected upper limit of the confidence intervals of strain and vaccine-specific efficacy based on incidence rate ratio.
#' @description
#' The function `get_cohort_expectedCI_VE_irr` simulates confindence intervals for strain and vaccine-specific efficacy (VE) for a given sample size.
#' The efficacy is defined as `VE = 1 - incidence rate ratio`, and the function returns expected lower and expected upper confidence interval limit for both absolute and relative VE.
#'
#' @param anticipated_VE_for_each_brand_and_strain a matrix of vaccine efficacy of each vaccine (row)  against each strain (column). Each value must be a real number between 0 and 1.
#' @param brand_proportions_in_vaccinated a vector denoting the proportion in which vaccines are given in the vaccinated subjects of the study cohort. Each value of this vector must be a real number between 0 and 1 and the sum of the values of this vector must be equal to 1.
#' @param overall_vaccine_coverage the proportion of the study cohort that will be vaccinated. It should be a real number between 0 and 1.
#' @param proportion_strains_in_unvaccinated_cases a vector of the proportions in which each strain is expected to be present in the unvaccinated and infected subjects in the study cohort. Each value of this vector must be a real number between 0 and 1 and the sum of the values of this vector must be equal to 1.
#' @param overall_attack_rate_in_unvaccinated the proportion of the study cohort that is expected to infected over the study period. It should be a real number between 0 and 1.
#' @param study_period the study period (epochs) should be numeric value greater than 0.
#' @param calculate_relative_VE a logical indicating if calculations should also be done for relative vaccine efficacy (default `TRUE`).
#' @param alpha controls the width `[100*alpha/2, 100*(1 - alpha/2)]%` of the confidence interval. It is a numeric that must take a value between 0 and 1.
#' @param confounder_adjustment_Rsquared we use this parameter to adjust the calculations for potential confounders using the methodology proposed by Hsieh and Lavori (2000). It represents the amount of variance (R^2) explained in a regression model where vaccination status is the outcome and confounders of interest are predictors. It is a numeric that must take a value between 0 (no adjustment for confounders) and 1.
#' @param prob_missing_data to adjust the calculations for non-informative and random subject loss to follow-up/dropout. it should take a numeric value between 0 and 1.
#' @param total_subjects a vector of study cohort size for which calculations should be done.
#' @param nsims total number of Monte Carlo simulations conducted.
#'
#' @details
#' #' In this function efficacy is defined as `VE = 1 - incidence rate ratio`, where 'incidence rate ratio' is
#' the ratio of incidence rates of being a case of a particular strain/variant among the groups being compared.
#' When the groups being compared are a particular vaccine versus placebo then we call the VE
#' as the absolute VE of the vaccine. For `M` vaccines there are `M` absolute VE, one each for the `M` vaccines.
#' When the groups being compared are a particular vaccine versus another vaccine then we call the VE
#' as the relative VE of the vaccines, for a particular strain. For `M` vaccines and `I` strains there are `I x 2 x utils::combn(M, 2)`
#' permutations of relative VE of two vaccines against the same strain.
#'
#' We first transform the user inputs for `I` strains and `M` vaccines into a `(I + 1) x (M + 1)` cross table of
#' cumulative-incidences of being a case or a control over the study period. The overall sum of all cumulative-incidences,
#' i.e., all cells, of this table is 1. The first row of our cumulative-incidence table contain cumulative-incidence of being a control.
#' The first column corresponds to subjects who are unvaccinated.
#' Thus, the cell `{1,1}` contains the probabitity (cumulative-incidence) that over the study period a subject will be a control and unvaccinated.
#' The remaining `ÃŒ` rows correspond to subjects who are cases of a particular strain/variant of the pathogen,
#' and the remaining `M` columns correspond to subjects who are vaccinated with a particular vaccine.
#' The next step is to simulate the data. To speed up our computations we sample an `(I + 1) x (M + 1)`
#' cross table of data from a multinomial distribution with probabilities taken from our cumulative-incidence table.
#' The total subjects sampled in the cross table are are `total_subjects * (1 - prob_missing_data)`.
#'
#' In the person-time based estimator of incidence rates the number of cases only constitute the numerator.
#' The denominator is person-time contributed by subjects vaccinated with a particular vaccine (or placebo).
#' Hence, in addition to the table of cumulative-incidences, using the user input we also obtain a `I x (M + 1)` table of incidence rates.
#' We use this table to calculate the person-time contribution of subjects over `study_period`.
#' In this table each cell contains the incidence rate of being a case of a particular strain given their vaccination status.
#' The naive method to calculate the overall person-time contribution of subjects vaccinated with a particular vaccine is to
#' simulate event-time of each subject using an exponential distribution (R function rexp). Subsequently, one can add them up over the subjects.
#' But this is computationally very slow. Hence we instead exploit the central limit theorem to directly sample the
#' 'sum of the person-time of all subjects with a certain vaccination status'.
#' For this, assume that the `study_period=t` and the sum of the event rates
#' for `I` strains is `p = p1 + p2 + ... + pI` per unit time, where `p1, p2, ..., pI` are the individual
#' event rates of the `I` strains. Then `exp(-pt)%` subjects will not be infected with the strain
#' and contribute `t` units time each. The remaining `100 - exp(-pt)%` subjects will
#' obtain the event and individually contribute an event time whose sum can be directly sampled from a
#' normal distribution (central limit theorem). This is because the sum of event times of `K`
#' eventful subjects follows a normal distributon with mean equal to
#' `K x mean of a truncated exponential distribution in the interval` `[0, t]`
#' and variance equal to the `K x variance of a truncated exponential distribution in the interval` `[0, t]`.
#'
#' We then estimate the absolute and relative VE of each vaccine using the counts and person-times based on the sampled data.
#' For this purpose we also reduce the sample size by a factor `prob_missing_data * confounder_adjustment_Rsquared`.
#' The confidence intervals with widths `[100*alpha/2, 100*(1 - alpha/2)]%` are obtained using normal approximation
#' to the distribution of log of incidence rate ratio (Rothman KJ, 2012).
#' To adjust for confounders, the standard-error used in the confidence interval is rescaled to `SE/(1 - confounder_adjustment_Rsquared)` (Hsieh and Lavori, 2000)
#' We repeat this procedure `nsims` times, and in each such simulation we obtain `nsims` confidence intervals.
#'
#' To conduct simulations faster all the calculations are done without using for loops.
#' Instead we use a three-dimensional R arrays, with one-dimension for `nsims`,
#' another for the sample size vector `total_subjects`,
#' and another for a vector containing the flattened cross table of simulated data on cases and controls.
#'
#' @return A data frame consisting of the input parameters, absolute and relative VE combinations, and the expected lower and expected upper width of the confidence intervals for each absolute and relative VE.
