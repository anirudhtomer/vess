#' Minimum detectable strain and vaccine-specific efficacy based on incidence rate ratio.
#' @description
#' The function `get_cohort_mindet_VE_irr` calculates the minimum detectable strain and vaccine-specific efficacy (VE) for a given sample size, power, and type-I error rate.
#' The efficacy is defined as `VE = 1 - incidence rate ratio`, and the function returns
#' both absolute and relative minimum detectable VE. The NULL hypothesis is that `VE = 0` and
#' the alternate hypothesis in that `VE is not equal to 0`.
#'
#' @param anticipated_VE_for_each_brand_and_strain a matrix of vaccine efficacy of each vaccine (row)  against each strain (column). Each value must be a real number between 0 and 1.
#' @param brand_proportions_in_vaccinated a vector denoting the proportion in which vaccines are given in the vaccinated subjects of the study cohort. Each value of this vector must be a real number between 0 and 1 and the sum of the values of this vector must be equal to 1.
#' @param overall_vaccine_coverage the proportion of the study cohort that will be vaccinated. It should be a real number between 0 and 1.
#' @param proportion_strains_in_unvaccinated_cases a vector of the proportions in which each strain is expected to be present in the unvaccinated and infected subjects in the study cohort. Each value of this vector must be a real number between 0 and 1 and the sum of the values of this vector must be equal to 1.
#' @param overall_attack_rate_in_unvaccinated the proportion of the study cohort that is expected to infected over the study period. It should be a real number between 0 and 1.
#' @param study_period the study period (epochs) should be numeric value greater than 0.
#' @param calculate_relative_VE a logical indicating if calculations should also be done for relative vaccine efficacy (default `TRUE`).
#' @param power the power to detect the VE. It is equal to 1 - Type-II error. It is a numeric that must take a value between 0 and 1.
#' @param alpha controls the width `[100*alpha/2, 100*(1 - alpha/2)]%` of the confidence interval. It is a numeric that must take a value between 0 and 1.
#' @param confounder_adjustment_Rsquared we use this parameter to adjust the calculations for potential confounders using the methodology proposed by Hsieh and Lavori (2000). It represents the amount of variance (R^2) explained in a regression model where vaccination status is the outcome and confounders of interest are predictors. It is a numeric that must take a value between 0 (no adjustment for confounders) and 1.
#' @param prob_missing_data to adjust the calculations for non-informative and random subject loss to follow-up/dropout. it should take a numeric value between 0 and 1.
#' @param total_subjects a vector of study cohort size for which calculations should be done.
#'
#' @details
#' In this function efficacy is defined as `VE = 1 - incidence rate ratio`, where 'incidence rate ratio' is
#' the ratio of incidence rates of being a case of a particular strain/variant among the groups being compared.
#' When the groups being compared are a particular vaccine versus placebo then we call the VE
#' as the absolute VE of the vaccine. For `M` vaccines there are `M` absolute VE, one each for the `M` vaccines.
#' When the groups being compared are a particular vaccine versus another vaccine then we call the VE
#' as the relative VE of the vaccines, for a particular strain. For `M` vaccines and `I` strains there are `I x 2 x utils::combn(M, 2)`
#' permutations of relative VE of two vaccines against the same strain.
#'
#' We first transform the user inputs for `I` strains and `M` vaccines into a `(I + 1) x (M + 1)` cross table of
#' cumulative-incidences of being a case or a control over the study period. The overall sum of all cumulative-incidences,
#' i.e., all cells, of this table is 1. The first row of our cumulative-incidence table contain cumulative-incidence of being a control.
#' The first column corresponds to subjects who are unvaccinated.
#' Thus, the cell `{1,1}` contains the probabitity (cumulative-incidence) that over the study period a subject will be a control and unvaccinated.
#' The remaining `ÃŒ` rows correspond to subjects who are cases of a particular strain/variant of the pathogen,
#' and the remaining `M` columns correspond to subjects who are vaccinated with a particular vaccine. In the
#' person-time based estimator of incidence rates the number of cases only constitute the numerator.
#' The denominator is person-time contributed by subjects vaccinated with a particular vaccine (or placebo).
#' Hence, in addition to the table of cumulative-incidences, using the user input we also
#' obtain a `I x (M + 1)` table of incidence rates.
#'
#' In general, while calculating minimum detectable VE it is not necessary to ask for `anticipated_VE_for_each_brand_and_strain`.
#' The reason we need it in the multiple variant and mulitple vaccine scenario is explained next.
#'
#' After we obtain the cumulative incidence table our next step is to calculate the minimum detectable VE for each absolute and relative VE combination.
#' For absolute VE we extract a `2 x 2` sub-table of cumulative-incidences from the larger `(I + 1) x (M + 1)` cross table of
#' cumulative-incidences. The two rows of this table are for the strain of interest and controls.
#' The two columns are for the vaccine of interest and placebo. The effective sample size for this sub-table and the absolute VE is then
#' `total_subjects * sub_table_probability_sum * (1 - prob_missing_data) * (1 - confounder_adjustment_Rsquared)`.
#' Here `sub_table_probability_sum` is the sum of the cells of the sub_table.
#' This sum corresponds to the percentage of the `total_subjects` that can be used for a specific absolute VE calculation.
#' The effective overall coverage in this sub-table is the rescaled probability of being vaccinated in the `2 x 2` sub-table.
#' The effective incidence rate of the strain in this comparison is the strain-specific incidence rate of the strain taken
#' from the table of incidence rates.
#' We then simply pass these adjusted parameters to the function `epi.sscohortt` of the R package `epiR` to obtain the minimum detectable absolute VE.
#' For relative VE the process is similar to absolute VE, except that instead of placebo we select a `2 x 2` sub-table where
#' the columns are two vaccines of interest.
#'
#' @return A data frame consisting of the input parameters, absolute and relative VE combinations,
#' and the minimum detectable VE for each absolute and relative VE combination.
#'
#' @examples As an example we recommend running the function without passing any parameter to it.
#' The default scenario is for three vaccines and three pathogen strains.
